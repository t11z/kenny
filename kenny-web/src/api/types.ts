/**
 * The frozen contract between `kenny-web` and the server's `/api` surface.
 *
 * This file is the single statement of every response shape the console depends
 * on. It is authored ahead of both sides so the frontend and the endpoint work
 * can proceed in parallel, and it is what the seam test checks: if a handler
 * stops returning one of these fields, the build or the seam test fails rather
 * than a panel silently rendering empty (root `CLAUDE.md`, "every seam two
 * places must agree on gets a test that fails when they diverge").
 *
 * Field names here are the server's, verbatim. Where a shape already exists in
 * `kenny_server`, the producing function is named in the comment; treat those as
 * observations of current behaviour, not as an invitation to reshape them.
 * Additive is the rule: new fields are added, existing ones are not renamed,
 * because the MCP surface and the agent read some of the same producers.
