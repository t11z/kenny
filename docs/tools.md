# Tool reference

This page catalogs every tool kenny exposes to Claude — over MCP (a local client) and in
the Ask kenny overlay — and explains which ones can change a PC, who has to approve them, and
where each call is recorded. For the operator workflow around these tools, see
[`user-guide.md`](user-guide.md).

## Two kinds of tools

kenny splits its tools into two families:

- **Capability tools** run on a single agent PC (Windows, Linux, or macOS). Every call names
  its target with an `agent_id` argument, forwards a `request` frame to that agent through
  the tunnel, and returns the agent's `response`. `powershell_exec`, `shell_exec`, the
  `fs_*`, `winget_*`, `diag_*`, `net_*` tools, `screen_capture`, `remotehelp_*`,
  `telemetry_collect`, and `agent_update` are all capability tools. `powershell_exec` and
  `shell_exec` are OS-scoped mirrors of each other (Windows vs. Linux/macOS) — the server's
  **OS guard** (below) refuses to forward the wrong one for a given agent's OS.
- **Server-only orchestration tools** read the registry, telemetry store, and health rules
  on the server. They are **never forwarded** to an agent: `list_agents`, `select_agent`,
  `fleet_overview`, `agent_health`, `agent_snapshot` (plus the server-side web-filter
  tools).

!!! note "`agent_id` targeting, and what `select_agent` actually does now ([ADR-0038](adr/0038-explicit-per-call-agent-targeting.md))"
    A remote MCP client (Claude Desktop, claude.ai) gives the server no reliable
    per-conversation identifier, so **every capability tool call over MCP must include its
    own `agent_id`** naming the target host — there is no server-side "current agent" a raw
    MCP call can rely on. `select_agent` still validates an id and is useful for discovery,
    but it no longer routes anything; passing it once and then omitting `agent_id` on a later
    call fails with an explicit `no_agent` error rather than guessing a host.

    The **Ask kenny overlay** is the one place a sticky selection is still safe, because each
    conversation is a genuinely separate, non-shared session: it forwards to whichever agent
    is selected in the dashboard's context pill, and the model can pass `agent_id` to target
    a different host for one call without changing that selection.

!!! note "Windows-only capabilities stay green on Linux CI"
    Capability tools that touch Windows internals have portable fallbacks in the agent, so
    `cargo test` / `cargo build` pass on Linux dev and CI. On a non-Windows host the
    affected tools return `error.code = "unsupported"` rather than failing the build. This
    is the agent's `#[cfg(windows)]` discipline.

## Three tiers, and who enforces what

Every tool is classified into one of **three tiers** (`kenny_server/tool_classes.py`, the
single source of truth):

- **`read_only`** — observes; changes nothing on the host or on the server.
- **`standard_change`** — a change that is routine, reversible and low-blast-radius:
  flushing a DNS cache, opening a remote-help session, updating an already-installed
  package, pushing a block list that is already configured.
- **`normal_change`** — everything else that changes state: arbitrary code execution,
  installing/uninstalling software, who may sign in to a family PC, changing what the
  server itself enforces. **Unknown tools fail closed into this tier.**

**The tier is a property of the tool. The gate is a property of the calling surface.** A
tier is never permission to skip a confirmation — it only says how consequential a change
is. Whether that consequence gets confirmed, runs autonomously, or is refused outright is
decided independently by whichever surface is calling: today the Ask kenny overlay and MCP,
and — for the Discord ticket surface described in [ITSM & the Discord bot](itsm.md) — a
per-tier autonomy split.

| Tier | Dashboard chat | MCP | Ticket chat (see [`itsm.md`](itsm.md)) | [Triage](itsm.md#kenny-looks-first-before-you-are-asked-to) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `read_only` | runs | runs | runs (a consent hold first, for a [privacy-sensitive](itsm.md#operator-approval-vs-user-consent-two-different-questions) one) | runs — but the privacy-sensitive ones are **withheld entirely** |
| `standard_change` | **holds** (confirm-gate) | runs | runs autonomously, with a trail row | same, and only `ticket_triage_verdict` is on offer |
| `normal_change` | **holds** (confirm-gate) | runs | **holds** for an operator's approval | **withheld entirely** |

The triage column is the one surface that *withholds* rather than gates, and the reason is
that it is the one surface with nobody in it: an unprompted investigation has no operator
to answer an approval and no person to give consent, so a hold would park the ticket
forever. A tool absent from its schemas is never a call to hold. See
[ADR-0056](adr/0056-unprompted-ticket-triage.md).

The Ask kenny overlay holds **both** change tiers, exactly as it always has — moving a tool
from `normal_change` to `standard_change` changes its blast-radius classification, never
whether the dashboard confirms it. Only the Discord ticket surface treats
`standard_change` as safe to run on its own, and it still records a trail row saying so.
See [ADR-0045](adr/0045-tiered-tool-classification.md) for why the tier and the gate are
kept apart, and [ADR-0009](adr/0009-server-hosted-claude-chat.md) for the dashboard
confirm-gate this refines.

![The Ask kenny overlay's confirm-gate pausing a state-changing winget_update until the operator approves.](assets/screenshots/ask-kenny.png)
*The confirm-gate pausing a `winget_update` until the operator approves. It is a
`standard_change` — which the Discord surface runs on its own, and Ask kenny still
confirms. That difference is the point of the table above: the tier describes the tool, the
surface decides the gate.*

Alongside the tier, two independent flags apply to a handful of tools regardless of which
surface calls them:

- **Privacy-sensitive** (`screen_capture`, `remotehelp_start`, `fs_read`,
  `web_activity_query`) — invoking the tool touches someone's privacy, or needs the person
  at the keyboard to know. On the Discord surface this needs the *affected person's*
  consent, separately from whether the caller is authorized — see
  [ITSM: operator approval vs. user consent](itsm.md#operator-approval-vs-user-consent-two-different-questions).
- **Redacted output** (`screen_capture`, `fs_read`, `fs_search`, `web_activity_query`,
  `diag_eventlog`) — the *result* carries screen pixels, file contents, event-log text or
  browsing history, and must never be echoed verbatim to an external chat surface; Discord
  summarises and links to the ticket in the authenticated dashboard instead.

The three-tier classification lives in one place, so it is worth being precise about the
**other** controls that also gate a call, independent of tier or surface:

| Control | Where it lives | What it does |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Role & host scope** ([ADR-0033](adr/0033-multi-user-authentication.md)) | Auth middleware + tool layer (server) | The access token — an OAuth token ([ADR-0037](adr/0037-oauth2-authorization-server-for-mcp.md)) or a personal access token — identifies a user; a `user`-role caller only sees/targets its assigned hosts (`select_agent`, `agent_*`, forwarders, and `list_agents`/`fleet_overview` are scope-filtered), and parental-controls mutation tools require `operator`+. The legacy shared token acts as a superuser. |
| **Capability profile** ([ADR-0047](adr/0047-capability-profiles.md)) | Tool schemas + dispatch (server) | An optional, named per-account tool allowlist that only ever *narrows* what the role already allows — checked twice: the tool is not offered to the model, and dispatch refuses it again. See [ITSM: capability profiles](itsm.md#capability-profiles). |
| **Agent-side safety guard** ([ADR-0019](adr/0019-agent-side-deterministic-tool-guard.md)) | Compiled into the agent | Deterministically refuses individually catastrophic calls (disk wipes, shadow-copy deletion, event-log clearing, Defender disable, sensitive-path `fs_*`, unlisted `agent_update` hosts) regardless of operator approval — and it cannot be turned off from the server. |
| **OS guard** | Server (forwarder) | Refuses `powershell_exec`/`shell_exec` for the wrong agent OS — e.g. `shell_exec` on a Windows agent — before ever forwarding, naming the correct tool. |
| **Local kill-switch** ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-local-remote-control-kill-switch.md)) | Agent + tray, at the PC | The person at the PC turns **all** state-changing tools off. Forwarded calls then return `error.code = "disabled"`; telemetry and read-only tools keep working. |

!!! warning "A raw MCP client is not confirm-gated"
    The confirm-gate is a property of the Ask kenny overlay loop, not of the server's tool
    surface. A raw external MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) pointed at `/mcp` is **not**
    confirm-gated by the server — every tier runs. The agent-side guard and the local
    kill-switch still apply — they are enforced at the agent, the boundary that actually
    runs the command — so they hold no matter who calls the tool. It also must name its
    target explicitly: every forwarded call takes its own `agent_id` (see the note above),
    so a raw MCP client can never fall back onto whatever host another concurrent session
    happened to select.

## Capability tools

Names are exactly as they appear on the wire, over MCP, and in the chat. The **Arguments**
column lists only each tool's own parameters — every capability tool additionally takes
`agent_id` naming the target host (required over MCP; optional in the Ask kenny overlay, where
it overrides the session's selection for one call). `agent_id` is routing metadata the
server consumes and never puts on the wire (ADR-0038).

### Shell

`powershell_exec` and `shell_exec` are OS-scoped mirrors: each runs only on its matching
agent OS (Windows / Linux+macOS) and is `unsupported` on the other. The server's **OS
guard** (see the confirm-gate table above) refuses to forward the wrong one before it ever
reaches the agent.

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `powershell_exec` | `script`, `timeout_s` | `normal_change` |
| `shell_exec` | `command`, `timeout_s` | `normal_change` |

### Files

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `fs_list` | `path` | `read_only` |
| `fs_search` | `root`, `pattern` | `read_only` (redacted output) |
| `fs_read` | `path` | `read_only` (privacy-sensitive, redacted output) |
| `fs_disk_usage` | — | `read_only` |

### Packages

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `winget_list` | — | `read_only` |
| `winget_install` | `id` | `normal_change` |
| `winget_uninstall` | `id` | `normal_change` |
| `winget_update` | `id?` | `standard_change` — updating an already-installed package is the routine, reversible half of the package family |

### Diagnostics

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `diag_processes` | — | `read_only` |
| `diag_services` | `filter?` | `read_only` |
| `diag_eventlog` | `log`, `count` | `read_only` (redacted output) |
| `diag_autostart` | — | `read_only` |

### Network

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `net_config` | — | `read_only` |
| `net_dns_flush` | — | `standard_change` |
| `net_adapter_reset` | `name` | `standard_change` |

### Screen

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `screen_capture` | — | `read_only` (privacy-sensitive, redacted output) |

Screenshots are captured in the interactive **user session** via the tray helper, not from
the session-0 service (which would grab a black frame) — see
[ADR-0018](adr/0018-screenshots-captured-in-user-session-via-tray.md).

### Remote help

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `remotehelp_status` | — | `read_only` |
| `remotehelp_start` | — | `standard_change` (privacy-sensitive) |
| `remotehelp_stop` | — | `standard_change` |

`remotehelp_start` launches Windows **Quick Assist** on the user's desktop; kenny acts as a
concierge, not the transport. A helper shares the 6-digit code and the person at the PC
must click **Allow** — the consent steps stay with the people
([ADR-0021](adr/0021-remote-help-concierge-via-user-session-launch.md)). It is `standard_change`
*and* privacy-sensitive at once — the case where both of Discord's gates apply to the same
call; see [ITSM: operator approval vs. user consent](itsm.md#operator-approval-vs-user-consent-two-different-questions).

### Telemetry

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `telemetry_collect` | `sections?` | `read_only` |

### Agent management

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `agent_update` | `version`, `url`, `sha256` | `normal_change` |

### Parental controls

Registered on the agent when the web filter is wired up. See
[`parental-controls.md`](parental-controls.md).

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `webfilter_status` | — | `read_only` |
| `webfilter_apply` | `domains`, `doh_policy`, `list_hash` | `normal_change` |
| `webfilter_clear` | — | `normal_change` |

### Account governance

Who may sign in to the machine. `principal` is the account name — the **same tool works
for a local, a Microsoft and a Linux account**, on **Windows and Linux hosts alike**,
because below this layer neither operating system draws the distinctions above it. There
is no `account_list`: the inventory is the `local_accounts` telemetry section, refreshable
on demand with `telemetry_collect` — and it is also where each account publishes the verbs
it *cannot* perform, with a reason. All of these require the `operator` role and are
confirm-gated — and every one is `normal_change`: deciding who may sign in to a family PC
is never routine. See [`account-governance.md`](account-governance.md).

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `account_set_enabled` | `principal`, `enabled` | `normal_change` |
| `account_set_admin` | `principal`, `admin` | `normal_change` |
| `account_set_logon_rights` | `principal`, `deny` (⊆ `network`, `remote_interactive`) | `normal_change` (`network` is Windows-only) |
| `account_create` | `name`, `password`, `display_name?`, `admin?` | `normal_change` (local accounts only; no asymmetry on Linux) |
| `account_delete` | `principal`, `remove_profile` | `normal_change` |
| `account_session_action` | `principal`, `action` (`lock` / `logoff`), `warn_seconds?` | `normal_change` |
| `password_policy_set` | `min_length?`, `max_age_days?`, `lockout_threshold?` | `normal_change` (accounts stored on the machine only) |

The agent refuses — with `blocked`, not overridable from the server — any call that would
disable, demote, delete or restrict the **last enabled administrator**, or delete a
built-in account.

## Server-only orchestration tools

These read server state and are never forwarded. All are read-only.

| Tool | Arguments | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `list_agents` | — | Known agents with online state and rolled-up health: `overall`, `flagged_sections` (the incidents — warn/crit) and `posture_sections` (standing facts that never roll up; see the status model in [telemetry.md](telemetry.md#status-model)). |
| `select_agent` | `id` | Validate an agent id and set the Ask kenny overlay's default (advisory only over MCP — it does not route forwarded calls there; see the note above). |
| `fleet_overview` | — | Per-agent rolled-up health for the whole fleet, in the same shape as `list_agents`. |
| `agent_health` | `id` | Per-section health for one agent: `status`, `summary`, `reason`, `attention`, `tier` (`incident` / `posture` / `none`), `since` and `age_seconds` (how long the section has held its current status, from the alert loop's state; null until it has seen it) and, where a rule has structured evidence, `details` (the reliability rule's per-pattern activity record, `win_update`'s per-KB failures). |
| `agent_snapshot` | `id`, `section?` | Latest stored telemetry snapshot (optionally one section). |

!!! note "`select_agent` is withheld from the Discord ticket surface"
    Every other server-only tool above is available wherever a Discord ticket's profile
    allows it; `select_agent` alone is filtered out there, because its only job is
    changing the target — exactly what a ticket freezes at creation. See
    [ITSM: the lifecycle](itsm.md#what-a-ticket-is-and-where-it-comes-from).

The server-side web-filter tools are also server-only. `webfilter_get` and
`web_activity_query` are `read_only`; `webfilter_set` and `webfilter_push` change state,
but at different tiers — `webfilter_set` changes *what* the server enforces,
`webfilter_push` only ships the already-configured list to the host, which is the routine
half.

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `webfilter_get` | `id` | `read_only` |
| `webfilter_set` | `id`, plus config toggles / `add_domain` / `remove_domain` | `normal_change` |
| `webfilter_push` | `id` | `standard_change` |
| `web_activity_query` | `id`, `hours?`, `flagged_only?` | `read_only` (privacy-sensitive, redacted output) |

Reliability alarm suppression (ADR-0041, issue #166) is server-only too: rules exclude a
`(source, event_id)` reliability event pattern from severity scoring, fleet-wide by default
or scoped to one host, without hiding its raw count. `reliability_suppression_add`/`_remove`
are `normal_change` (they hit the ADR-0009 confirm-gate in the Ask kenny overlay).

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `reliability_suppression_list` | `agent_id?` | `read_only` |
| `reliability_suppression_add` | `event_id`, `source?`, `agent_id?`, `note?` | `normal_change` |
| `reliability_suppression_remove` | `rule_id` | `normal_change` |

Auto-ticket rules are also server-only: they decide which alerts open a ticket
automatically, by default every genuine alert and nothing else. Operator+ on every one of
these, including the read — an alert-origin ticket is itself operator-only, so a scoped
`user` has no legitimate use for the rules that decide when one opens.

| Tool | Arguments | Tier |
|------|-----------|------|
| `ticket_rule_list` | `agent_id?` | `read_only` |
| `ticket_rule_set` | `event_type`, `decision`, `section?`, `agent_id?`, `note?` | `normal_change` |
| `ticket_rule_remove` | `rule_id` | `normal_change` |

## Auditing

Every forwarded capability call is appended to the **tool-call audit log**, annotated
read-only vs state-changing (plus, additively, its tier), with its agent, timestamp, and
ok/error outcome. Read it in the dashboard's **[Log](dashboard.md#log)** page, filtered to
the TOOLS chip. See [`dashboard.md`](dashboard.md).

![The Log page, filtered to tool calls, each tagged read-only or state-changing.](assets/screenshots/log.png)

## Tool naming

Tools use **Anthropic-native `snake_case` names**, identical to the wire-contract tool
catalog ([ADR-0016](adr/0016-anthropic-native-tool-naming.md)). There is one canonical
identifier per tool across the contract, fixtures, MCP, the Ask kenny overlay, and the agent's
dispatch table — no boundary translation. The same names you see here appear over MCP and
in the chat.
