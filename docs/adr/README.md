# Architecture Decision Records

kenny's architecture decisions in [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format, and the only
kind of record kenny keeps. What qualifies: *When (not) to write an ADR* in the repository
`CLAUDE.md`, applied by `/new-adr` before it scaffolds anything.

- Numbered `NNNN-kebab-title.md` as a gap-free `0001..N` sequence; the index is the record
  set, and a number always names the record at that position.
- `0000-template.md` is the MADR template — copy it for a new record (`/new-adr`).
- A record is immutable once accepted; later decisions **amend** or **supersede** it via a
  new record. The one exception: an accepted record may gain a dated
  `## Update (YYYY-MM-DD)` section refining *how* it is implemented. Anything that changes
  what was decided needs a new record.
- A number is an address, not content — repairing a link or renumbering is not an edit to
  a decision.
