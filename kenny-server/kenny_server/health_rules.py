    section has a rule and that rule reaches a verdict, that verdict *is* the
    status — the ``status`` the agent put in the payload is not folded in. The
    agent computes its own status from a handful of local constants it cannot
    change without being redeployed, which is exactly the judgement this module
    exists to own; letting it raise a verdict it can never lower means a
    server-side threshold change (or an operator suppression, ADR-0041) can
    only ever tighten a section, never relax one. ``reliability`` showed what
    that costs: the collector reports ``warn`` at 20 error events in 7 days, a
    bar every real Windows PC clears, so no amount of server-side scoring could
    put the section back to ``ok``.

    The agent's ``status`` still stands alone where this module has nothing to
    say — a section with no rule, or a rule that defers by returning ``None``
    (a payload missing the fields it scores). There the agent is the only
    judgement available, and it is used unchanged.
