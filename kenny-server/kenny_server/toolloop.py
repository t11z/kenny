"""The surface-independent tool-use core: catalog, executor, and the loop.

This is the Anthropic tool-use loop with every surface-specific decision lifted
out into a :class:`LoopPolicy`. The loop knows how to talk to the model, run a
tool, feed the result back, pause, and resume. It does **not** know which system
prompt to send, which tools to expose, where a call is routed, or whether a call
may proceed — a policy object answers all four.

That split is what makes a second surface possible without forking the loop: the
dashboard's policy (``chat.FleetPolicy``) holds every state-changing call for
an operator confirmation, and a different surface can hold, deny or allow on its
own terms while the loop's event shapes, ordering and truncation stay identical.

The loop is deliberately duck-typed over its session object. It touches only
``.id``, ``.messages``, ``.agent_id``, ``.pending``, ``._queue`` and
``._staged_results`` — no base class, no ``isinstance`` checks — and it never
imports ``chat.py``, so the dependency runs one way: ``chat`` -> ``toolloop``.
