"""Server-side alert evaluation loop (ADR-0027).

Periodically re-evaluates every known agent's latest snapshot with the
authoritative health rules and notifies the operator on *transitions* only:
ok->warn, ok->crit, warn->crit (escalation), warn/crit->ok (recovery) and
online<->offline. Thresholds stay exclusively in ``health_rules.py``; this
module only compares the evaluated status against the persisted last-known
state (``AlertStateStore``) and applies flap suppression:

* a per-scope cooldown (default 1 h) bounds a flapping section to at most one
  alert plus one recovery per cooldown window,
* escalations to ``crit`` always fire,
* a recovery is only notified when the degraded episode itself was notified.

Offline detection is push-based: an agent is offline when its newest snapshot
is older than ``offline_after_s`` (default three missed 900 s push intervals)
and the in-memory registry has no live connection. Health evaluation is
skipped for offline agents so stale snapshots cannot flap.

Every emitted notification is also persisted to the events table
(``kind='alert'``) as the audit trail and the weekly digest's input.

*Which* channels it is delivered on is asked fresh at every dispatch through a
``notifier_provider`` (ADR-0054), not fixed at construction, so an operator who
adds or clears a channel in the dashboard sees it apply to the next alert
without a restart. Zero channels stays a legitimate state — the loop still
evaluates and records, it just pushes nothing.

An optional ``open_ticket`` callable may be injected to turn a notification
into a ticket. It is opt-in (a server without the ticket surface simply passes
nothing) and best-effort: delivery happens first and a failing ticket call is
logged, never raised — alerting must not become less reliable by gaining a
side effect (ADR-0027). *Which* notifications actually open a ticket is
operator policy, decided by an optional ``ticket_rules`` mirror
(:class:`kenny_server.ticket_rules.TicketRuleList`) consulted through the same
``ticket_rules.decide`` function whether or not any rule is configured -- with
no rules the outcome is byte-for-byte the old hardcoded rule (a genuine alert
opens a ticket, a recovery/change/digest does not), so the default cannot
drift from the ruled case. A recovery or the digest can never open a ticket,
no matter what any rule says (see ``ticket_rules.NEVER_TICKETED_KINDS``).
