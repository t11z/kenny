# -- process-wide write serialization (ADR-0051) ------------------------------
#
# SQLite already allows only one writer at a time; ``busy_timeout`` bounds how
# long a second writer waits for that single slot before raising. That bound
# was still not enough: a connection that has *no* ``busy_timeout`` (see the
# five stores this module's docstring above used to omit it for) can leave a
# multi-statement write half-finished — the driver never rolls back on error —
# and hold the WAL writer lock indefinitely, so every other writer's full
# timeout elapses and it raises "database is locked" anyway. Fixing that gap
# closes the trigger; this lock removes the blast radius: this process's own
# writers queue on an ``asyncio.Lock`` instead of racing SQLite's single-writer
# slot, so a stuck or merely slow writer delays the next one rather than
# starving it out from under a busy_timeout.
#
# Two properties that are easy to get wrong:
#
# * **Re-entrant per task.** ``ticketstore._insert_event`` writes on its
#   caller's transaction and is called *inside* other write methods
#   (``set_state``, ``set_agent_id``, ``append_event``). A plain
#   ``asyncio.Lock`` taken at both levels self-deadlocks. Re-entrancy is keyed
#   on ``asyncio.current_task()`` identity, not a ``ContextVar`` — a task
#   spawned *while* the lock is held inherits the parent's context, and a
#   ContextVar flag would make that child believe it already holds the lock.
# * **Bound to one event loop.** ``asyncio.Lock`` binds to the loop of its
#   first ``acquire`` and raises if reused from another (pytest-asyncio gives
#   each test its own loop). State lives in a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed by
#   the running loop instead of a single module-level lock.
#
# The rule that makes the ticket-store case the *only* nesting, and therefore
# keeps this deadlock-free: take the lock only inside individual store
# methods, immediately around the statements it protects — never around a
# loop, and never around an ``await`` that reaches the tunnel, an LLM call, or
# any callback the caller supplied (e.g. a ticket gate resumer). A write held
# across I/O like that would stall every other writer in the process for the
# duration of that I/O.
