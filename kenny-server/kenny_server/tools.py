"""MCP tool registration.

Two kinds of tools (names match ``docs/protocol.md`` § Tool catalog exactly):

* **Forwarding capability tools** — require an explicit ``agent_id`` argument
  naming the target host, and forward a ``request`` frame to it through the
  tunnel (see ADR-0038). ``agent_id`` is routing metadata: it is popped off the
  call's ``args`` before the wire frame is built, so it never reaches the agent
  and the wire contract is untouched.
* **Server-only tools** — ``list_agents``, ``select_agent``, ``fleet_overview``,
  ``agent_health``, ``agent_snapshot`` — read from the registry, store, and
  health rules; they are not forwarded to a single agent.

Every forwarded call is appended to an in-memory ``call_log`` for the dashboard
tool-call log.

``select_agent``/the registry's active-agent slot (ADR-0033) remain as an
advisory discovery/back-compat helper only — they no longer decide where a
forwarded MCP call lands (ADR-0038). Remote MCP clients (Claude Desktop,
claude.ai) send no reliable per-conversation identifier, so two concurrent
sessions authenticated with the same credential (PAT/OAuth token) would
otherwise share one sticky slot and silently clobber each other's selection.
Requiring ``agent_id`` on every forwarded call makes that race structurally
impossible: a call either names its host or fails closed.
