# -- malformed nested telemetry fields must never raise (fuzzing sweep) ------
#
# `Section.model_config` allows arbitrary extra fields (`docs/protocol.md`), so
# the wire contract never guarantees that a nested field a rule expects to be a
# dict/list of dicts actually is one -- a buggy or compromised agent can send a
# section whose own `status`/`summary` validate fine but whose extra fields
# don't match a rule's assumed shape. Every one of these previously raised
# AttributeError/TypeError out of `evaluate_section`, which crashes the caller
# (`fleet_overview`/`list_agents`/`agent_health` iterate all agents in one
# comprehension with no per-agent guard, so one malformed host's telemetry took
# the whole read down for every host).
