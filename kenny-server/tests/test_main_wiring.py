"""Composition-root tests: what ``build_app`` actually wires up.

Three properties this module pins down, because each of them is a promise the
integration makes rather than a property of any single component:

* **Tickets do not depend on Discord.** A server with no Discord configuration
  starts, serves the fleet API and serves the whole ticket API, and creates no
  Discord task at all.
* **The optional loops are opt-out at startup.** The ticket sweeper is created
  when its interval is non-zero and not created when it is zero, the same
  convention the alert/backup/update loops follow.
* **The Discord surface can never take the server down.** With the optional
  ``discord.py`` dependency missing, a fully configured Discord surface still
  starts the server; the gateway's ``GatewayUnavailable`` is logged once and
  swallowed.

Plus the alert -> ticket hook, which is injected into the alert engine and must
not make alert delivery any less best-effort (ADR-0027).
