"""Regression tests for the shared SQLite connection settings.

Every store opens its own connection to the *same* file. If any of them omits
``busy_timeout`` (SQLite default: 0), momentary write contention raises
``OperationalError: database is locked`` instead of waiting — which previously
propagated out of the agent tunnel and flapped every agent's WebSocket. These
tests pin WAL + a non-zero busy_timeout on every store, and prove a second
writer waits for a held lock instead of failing immediately.

``ALL_STORES`` must cover every store class in the package, not a hand-picked
subset — a store that quietly skips ``_configure_connection`` (as five of them
once did) is exactly the kind of gap this file exists to catch, so a docstring
promise of "every store" that is not actually true defeats the point. See
``test_all_store_classes_are_covered`` below.
