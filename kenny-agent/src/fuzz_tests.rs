//! Randomized fuzz-style tests for the wire-facing `dispatch::handle` entry point.
//!
//! `request.args` arrives off the wire as an untyped `serde_json::Value` (see
//! `protocol::Request`) — a malicious or buggy server can put anything there. This
//! feeds `dispatch::handle` adversarial `(tool, args)` pairs and asserts the call
//! never panics, only ever returning an `ok`/`err` response.
//!
//! Mutating tools (see `control::is_mutating`) are exercised with the local kill
//! switch explicitly OFF, so the fuzzer-generated args never reach a handler that
//! would actually run a shell command, touch an account, or change network config —
//! they only exercise the `Disabled` short-circuit in `dispatch::run`. Switching it
//! off takes a control file that says so: remote control ships **on** and a missing
//! file reads as enabled (ADR-0011), so an unset `KENNY_CONTROL_FILE` is the *most*
//! permissive state, not the safest one. [`fuzz_dispatch_never_panics`] asserts the
//! switch really is off before it fuzzes anything, because nothing else in the test
//! would notice if it were not.
//!
//! Tools are split by whether their handler actually reads `args`:
//! - [`RANDOM_LOOP_TOOLS`] either deserialize `args` into something handler-specific
//!   (`fs_*`) or are mutating and gated off before a handler ever sees `args` —
//!   cheap either way, so these run thousands of times with fresh random args each
//!   iteration.
//! - [`SMOKE_ONCE_TOOLS`] are non-mutating handlers whose top-level signature is
//!   `_args: Value` (Windows-only diagnostics/network/remotehelp/webfilter status
//!   reads): they ignore `args` completely, so randomizing it thousands of times adds
//!   no coverage, while several of them do a real OS/WMI/subprocess call on Windows
//!   that is too slow to repeat thousands of times in CI. Each is called exactly once,
//!   which is all the args-blind routing path needs. Every one of them reaches the OS
//!   through a probe that kills its child on timeout, so a wedged host costs this test
//!   a bounded wait and never a stuck one. `screen_capture` is deliberately not
//!   dispatched for real here at all (not even once) — like the existing
//!   `dispatch::tests::screen_capture_paused_while_protected_game_runs`, which only
//!   exercises it behind the coexist gate, its real Windows capture path depends on
//!   an interactive session/IPC pipe that a CI runner may not have, so it belongs in
//!   the dedicated integration job, not a unit-test fuzz loop.
//! - `telemetry_collect` belongs in neither list, and is never dispatched here with
//!   random args. Its handler reads `args` only to build a section filter, and
//!   anything that is not an array of strings under `sections` selects *every*
//!   section — a full snapshot, which on Windows is ~35 PowerShell/CIM probes and on
//!   Linux is the same number of `n/a` stubs. Random args land on that case the vast
//!   majority of the time, so a random loop over this tool costs a real snapshot per
//!   iteration for no coverage the two split-out paths do not already give: the
//!   args-reading half is fuzzed as the pure [`dispatch::wanted_sections`] in
//!   [`fuzz_telemetry_section_filter_never_panics`], and the routing half is
//!   dispatched for real in [`fuzz_dispatch_never_panics`] behind an explicit
//!   section filter, so at most one cheap collector ever runs.
